## Usage
  ### PouchDB:
  The fastest method to get started with our project is by executing the following commands in a command prompt<br/>
  (we use C:\CSDL as a root folder for the remainder of the instructions):
  * C:\CSDL> git clone https://github.com/Tuanhoang2302/PouchDB_MySQL_Comparison.git
  * C:\CSDL> cd PouchDB source code
  * C:\CSDL\PouchDB source code> nodemon server (or node server) <br/>
  (but running by nodemon is far better than running by node) <br /> 
  (if you haven't installed nodemon, go to this [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to install) <br />
  
  When node server has started, you can open our project in VScode, check out our api and run&test queries by [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) <br />
  (We use [expressjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), a web application framework for Node.js <br/>
  If you dont know how expressjs works, please following [here](https://expressjs.com/))
